# Tagalong - Introduction
This document aims to help Pythonistas understand Go syntax at a glance by
leveraging Python and Go examples that do identical work and a short explanation
of Go's syntax preceding said examples.

Hopefully Pythonistas will learn Go is about the same level as Python when
one speaks of "high/low" level programming languages. 

There is a version of this document that also includes a Zig program 
to drive the previous point home and for those curious on a lower level language
that could replace C in academia.

**You'll find the examples which the section will refer to at the end of the section.**
